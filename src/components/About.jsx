            <p>
                I&apos;m passionate and dedicated about web development. I&apos;ve got a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I always want to learn more.
                I&apos;m currently working on expanding my skills in front-end development, and also learning into back-end development as well.
                I&apos;m also interested in learning more about UX/UI design and how to create websites that are accessible to everyone.
                In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and exploring new technologies. I&apos;m always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others and contribute to meaningful projects.
